# ml_2021_final_project

The jupyter notebook in this repository contains all the code to reproduce the results of my final project.
The ``requirements.txt`` contains all the python packages I had installed (not all of them are used in the notebook).

The dataset should be either downloaded manually from [this link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00341/HAPT%20Data%20Set.zip) to the folder ``$REPO_ROOT/dataset`` or else the notebook will download the dataset to this location automatically.

### Animations
The animations that I used for the video were created using [Manim Community Edition](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim) which is an animation engine. All the source code of the animations that can be seen in the video are located in the [Animations/VideoScenes.py](Animations/VideoScenes.py) file.

### References
The file [references.txt](references.txt) contains the sources that I used for some parts of the video.
